Openclassrooms Exercise.

- Download Node
- Open folder of this project and use "npm install" command
- After installation, use "npm start" command"
- If your browser doesn't open, then open it at http://localhost:8081

On this exercise I have only changed the "Book.js'" file to create the Book class with the read Book method and some instances to test this.
